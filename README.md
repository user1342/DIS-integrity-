DIS{integrity} is a tool for analyzing Android APKs, focusing on identifying root, integrity, and tamper detection checks inside of the APK. It uses APKTool to break down APK files and extracts data from Android manifests, smali code, and other resources to identify these security checks. The tool generates an easy-to-understand HTML report, helping offensive security researchers identify root and tamper detection checks in APKs for patching, hooking, and mitigating.

# ‚û°Ô∏è Getting Started
## Installation
Getting started with DIS{integrity} is easy! Follow these steps:

1) Clone the repository to your local machine.
2) Install the dependencies manually or via the included requirements file using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt
```
3) **Download APKTool for your system from [their website](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/documentation/). and make sure it's installed and available in your PATH.**

DIS{integrity} has been tested on Windows 11.

## Running
DIS{integrity} takes the following arguments. ```-apk``` is required. 

```
Detect root checks in Android APK files

arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -apk APK_FILE_PATH, --apk_file_path APK_FILE_PATH the path to the APK file to analyze
  -o OUTPUT_DIR, --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR the output directory to store the analysis results
  --apktool APKTOOL     the path to the apktool executable if not on PATH
```

Then run DIS{integrity} as follows. Afterwhich a HTML output file will be created.

```
python DISintegrity.py -apk <path to apk>
```

# üîé Behind The Scenes
DIS{Integrity} performs string pattern matching against symbols found in files inside of the APK. When these are matched against strings inside of SMALI files, they are listed in the output with a code block of the SMALI, while when found as a string in another (i.e. ```.so``` or ```.bin``` file), the file location is displayed. Due to this, DIS{Integrity} will not work on heavily obfuscated APKs. If you find yourself working on such an APK first try out some other tools for deobfuscation: [Obfu[DE]scate](https://github.com/user1342/Obfu-DE-Scate), [TinySmaliEmulator](https://github.com/amoulu/TinySmaliEmulator), [simplify](https://github.com/CalebFenton/simplify), and [deoptfuscator](https://github.com/Gyoonus/deoptfuscator). 

The strings used for this matching can be seen below:
